## Introduction
The Ticket Management System is a multi-threaded application designed to simulate a Ticketing System. Vendors add tickets to a shared ticket pool, while customers retrieve tickets based on a defined rate. The system provides a controlled and synchronized environment for managing ticket distribution efficiently. The project includes a Spring Boot backend and a React.js frontend, providing a comprehensive full-stack solution.
