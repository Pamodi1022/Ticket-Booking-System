🚀 Overview
The Ticket Management System is a high-performance, multi-threaded application designed to simulate a real-time ticketing platform. Vendors release tickets into a synchronized pool, while customers retrieve them at a controlled rate. This system ensures smooth and efficient ticket distribution with real-time updates.

🔹 Backend: Spring Boot

🔹 Frontend: React.js

🔹 Concurrency Handling: Multi-threading with synchronized ticket pools
